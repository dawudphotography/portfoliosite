Easily revert back to a previous version of your plugins, themes, media files and config file.

== Description ==

= How it works =
This plugin will make weekly backups of your plugins, themes, media files, configuration file and exports of your posts & pages and database. With the premium version this will be done every day. It also gives you the ability to easily place back accidentally deleted files or data. Most importantly even when your site (and WordPress) has become unavailable, you'll most likely be able to repair your website and have it up and running again, without help from a third party and no technical knowledge required.

Most hosts back up the entire server, including your site, but it takes time to request a copy of your site from their backups, and a speedy recovery is critical. With wp.repair you can resolve the problem yourself without help from a third party and no technical knowledge required.
